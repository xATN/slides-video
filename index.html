# Alien Basics

Note:
* Welcome to Alien Basics

---

## Define

* An *Alien* is a Perl module
* Provides an **external**, **non-Perl** dependency
* Probe for **existing system libraries** if available
* **build the library from source**, if not

Note:
* The Alien namespace in CPAN reserved for
* CPAN Modules
* That provide external, non-Perl dependencies
* And make them available for other Perl modules.
* They do this
* By probing for existing system libraries, if they are available
* And they will download and build the library from source
* If not

---

## Why?

Without an *Alien* an **XS** or **FFI** module must rely on
a user to pre-install any non-Perl dependency

Note:
* Without an Alien
* An XS or FFI module
* Must rely on the user to pre-install any non-Perl dependencies
* Before installing the Perl module

---

## Why?

Some **libraries** or **platforms** can make it difficult to install
some dependencies.

Note:
* Some libraries or platforms
* Can make it difficult to install some dependencies
* And requiring the user to do this ahead of time creates a barrier to entry
* Espeically if the user just wants to try out your module.

---

## Why?

**CPAN Testers** cannot automatically install non-Perl dependencies
without an *Alien*

Note:
* Automated tools, such as CPAN Testers
* Cannot automatically install non-Perl dependencies
* Without an Alien
* So using an Alien will give you more feedback
* From CPAN Testers and other tools
* Than what you would otherwise get

---

## Alien Install Flow

<img src="images/Alien-flowchart.png" style="width: 35%">

Note:
* The control flow for installing an Alien
* Starts with your cpan client such as cpanm
* At the configure stage the Alien will probe the system for the alienized package
* If it can't be found
* At build time
* The library will be downloaded from the internet
* Built from source
* And installed in a share directory
* This is an important detail, since the alienized package
* Needs to be available to other Perl modules
* But we do not want to pollute the host system with possibly incompatible libraries
* For this reason, this type of install is called a "share" install
* At this point we record the compiler and linker flags needed
* For using the alienized package
* If the library was provided by the system
* We can skip the download, build and install of the alienized package
* And just record the compiler and linker falgs from the system
* This type of install is called a "system" install
* At test time, a well behaved alien will test that the alienized package can be used
* With XS and FFI
* This will catch errors early and avoid installing a broken Alien

---

## Alien Dependency

<img src="images/Alien-dependency-chart.png" style="width: 35%">

Note:
* NOTE FIX COLOR of Foo::FFI
* Once you've created an Alien you can use it as a dependency
* for XS or FFI modules.
* I recommend using the Alien::Build / Alien::Base / alienfile framework
* For building Aliens
* These tools handle a lot of corner cases
* And will help you avoid re-inventing the wheel

---

## Demo

Let's write *Alien::libarchive*

Note:
* Now I'm going to show you how to create your own Alien
* We will write an Alien for the BSD libarchive library
